# scalajs-react-material-ui

Facade for material-ui 1.5.0 in scalajs-react.

Contains code to generate a facade for each material-ui component, based on the json API descroption generated by react-docgen from material-ui itself, and the results of that generation.

This uses a few heuristics to assign more detailed types (mostly for functions), and to include props from base classes (e.g. ButtonBase).

Project is in a very early state:

1. Only a few components have been tested, incompletely.
2. Some types are approximate, in particular `PropTypes.oneOfType` is just presented as `js.Any`.
3. Common React events are presented with correct event types, other event props just expect a Callback and will therefore discard event parameters (if any).

## Todo

1. Support `PropTypes.oneOfType`
2. Better support and testing of array props
3. Colors
4. Icons
5. More testing/demos
6. Check all components are included
7. ExpansionPanel onChange parameters
