# scalajs-react-material-ui

Facade for material-ui 1.5.0 in scalajs-react.

Contains code to generate a facade for each material-ui component, based on the json API descroption generated by react-docgen from material-ui itself, and the results of that generation.

This uses a few heuristics to assign more detailed types (mostly for functions), and to include props from base classes (e.g. ButtonBase).

Project is in a very early state:

1. Only a few components have been tested, incompletely.
2. Some types are approximate, in particular `PropTypes.oneOfType` is just presented as `js.Any`.
3. Common React events are presented with correct event types, other event props just expect a Callback and will therefore discard event parameters (if any).

## Building

Code generation is not done the right way - .scala files are just generated directly into the js src folder, under org.rebeam.mui, by 

To regenerate the muiapi.json describing the components, check out the material-ui project, then in the root, run react-docgen:
```
npx react-docgen .\packages\material-ui\src\ -o muiapi.json --pretty
```

You may need to trim some non-component data, for 1.5.0 this was just a `reactHelpers.js` at the end of the file.

Then copy the `muiapi.json` file to resources. 

## Todo

1. Support `PropTypes.oneOfType`
2. Better support and testing of array props
3. Colors
4. Icons
5. More testing/demos
6. Check all components are included
7. ExpansionPanel onChange parameters
8. Any other missing events from native elements? E.g. onClick on MenuItem is not documented.
9. Aria properties
10. id, ref, etc.
11. Detect classes prop and accept a Map[String, String]?
